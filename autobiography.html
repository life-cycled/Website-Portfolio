                <p>
                    "I did not sign up for this!" 
                    <br>
                    ...Says many of us, entering a difficult era of our lifetime. Whether it's struggling in a new 
                    environment or facing the new realities of adulthood, it is an easy statement to emphasize that 
                    we are NOT having fun.
                </p>

                <p>Just by being born, we have all been thrown into an overwhelming environment that forces you to 
                sink or swim throughout your time of life. This has become more apparent to myself as I enter my early 
                twenties. Through the many hardships I have been faced with already, I have begun to realize how 
                important these hardships are in order for me to get stronger with not only dealing with more of them, 
                but also to begin to find my place in this world.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">♡</p>

                <p>The biggest turning point of my life was when my mother took her own life when I was 17. Nothing 
                could have prepared me for it, and although the warning signs were screaming at me more and more over 
                the years, I refused to hear them because I believed that to be a reality I could not live through. 
                A reality that could not happen.</p>

                <p>The mental struggles of my mother had been an issue in our family for as long as I could know. I 
                eventually believed them to be normal. As a child, I could not understand both why my friends' mothers 
                seemed happy, and why my friends seem appalled when I mention my mother struggling, such as the times 
                she would be in the hospital. </p>

                <p>It's like watching the process of aging. Someone appears to look the same to you as they did last 
                year. This then takes place over some time and then you look back to the beginning and realize their 
                appearance is drastically different now. This was the same in this situation, when my mother was at 
                her worst, it felt to me like nothing had changed, making the event of suicide seem impossible. It 
                took me years to realize that, looking from an outside perspective, it unfortunately fit the 
                situation.</p>

                <p>Ever since that moment, I felt lost. My sister had been moved out and my father, in his form of 
                grief, turned a blind eye to who he had left to share his home with. I stood alone. I found solace in 
                my partner, enough so to cause me to move across the country to Michigan to be with him and his family. 
                Although this came with a better support system, it was a foreign area. I had never felt more alone 
                and with a lack of direction.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">♡</p>

                <p>My father worked his way up in healthcare until he reached the title of Director of Surgery. 
                    <i>
                        "This is my only example, so I guess that's what I'll do, too."
                    </i> 
                    I started to take classes at Lake Michigan College, aiming for their nursing program. I also got 
                    a job working in a dispatch office at our local hospital.
                </p>

                <p>Within the first semester and a few months at my new job, I found to hate the healthcare industry. 
                It has my respect as one of the most important industries to humanity, but all I could help but see 
                was the suffrage of patients and cranky nurses.</p>

                <p>I immediately switched my major and started taking gen-eds. Once I could no longer turn to taking a 
                required math or English class, I tried a programming logic and design class. Learning the structure 
                of code was a bit of a struggle, but once I started to apply it in real programs, that's when it 
                changed.</p>

                <p>Even in the beginning with simple math problems, it was always a thrill to see the successful 
                outcome built off of the code that I wrote. For the first time in my life, I felt motivated to do 
                schoolwork.</p>

                <p>My outlook went from taking college classes because I <i>have to</i> because I want to achieve 
                something. For the few years before this, the mix of trauma and lack of direction led me to believe I 
                did not possess a passion that would prove useful to me in life. I thought I was going to end up 
                working a job that I hated and only spending my free time playing video games. I was desperate for a 
                solution.</p>

                <p>Now, even though I still sort of lack a clear goal of specialization within my career path, I know 
                what I want to do. Homework does not feel like a task to me anymore. <br> ... I like school?</p>


                <p>Time is approaching fast to enroll in University for a Bachelor's Degree. Over the last few months, 
                I have had no trouble getting into select schools and have even received some scholarships, which I 
                never had before.</p>

                <p>My partner would celebrate me for my grades and these school offers. I didn't understand why, I 
                was just doing my own thing. It only recently hit me that, besides the struggle to understand some 
                concepts (which is to be expected), programming sort of comes naturally to me. My partner's stepmother says I just have the right mind for it. Either way, I am enjoying what I am doing and I am having a good time doing it.</p>

                <p>I now have no guilt in indulging my hobbies as they are not all I have anymore. I have even been 
                able to mix both aspects of my life. Video games are comprised of code. Along with learning the 
                language my favorite game is written in during school, I have begun to teach myself to create my own 
                game mods. Now, programming has breached the scope of just being schoolwork and has made its way into 
                my personal life and what I do for fun.</p>

                <p>For the first time I am feeling fulfillment. I am feeling belonging. I have a passion. You always 
                hear your older peers discussing the importance of self-discovery and how one day you will experience 
                it. Now, I am learning that this is true.</p>

                <p>Take a moment to reflect on your journey—consider the activities that invoke a genuine spark, the 
                moments when time seems to pause. These are the clues to your authentic self. In a world of being 
                pressured to conform, embracing your passions can guide you toward your own fulfillment. You will not 
                only find purpose but also contribute to your sense of existence.</p>
